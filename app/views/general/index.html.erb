					Introducing myfinancialfit.com "matching a family's affordability with the net price of colleges."  Most College Search programs deal with a set of preferencesâ€¦.major, geographic area, size of campus, academic profile of student body.  Myfinancialfit.com focuses on net price and encourages families to find a list of colleges that they know they can afford prior to searching for colleges based on a set of preferences.<br /><br />
					Myfinancialfit.com allows families to do affordability assessments and value assessments.  Are the colleges that interest me the most affordable?  Do colleges with similar features and benefits have similar net prices?  How do I find these affordable college options, these "financial fits?"
